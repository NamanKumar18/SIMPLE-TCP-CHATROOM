# SIMPLE-TCP-CHATROOM
---
## Created a simple TCP-based chatroom using python. 

> This is the first iteration to this project.

> I used _Data Communication and Networking by Forouzan_ and _NeuralNine Networking playlist(bit.ly/33RL1mc)_ as refernce for this simple TCP-based chatroom in python. 

> It runs over the local machine as two seperate programs, (namely The server and Client) connected via a socket over an IP and Port address.

> Many clients can be connected over the server and processed at the same time by the use of multithreading and share data simultaneously over the server following TCP. 

> It is a simple yet effective showcase of Network Communication by python

### Some of the libraries used:
- socket
- threading
